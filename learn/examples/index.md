title: A Quick Tour of Wicket
---
Nothing says more about a development technology than a few simple examples.
After all, how hard should it be to do something easy? The examples below
should speak for themselves in demonstrating how easy it is to get things done
in Wicket when compared to other frameworks. You will discover that Wicket's
component-oriented structure and its "low touch" approach to HTML is quite
inviting.

You can see these examples and many more in [live
action](http://www.wicket-library.com/wicket-examples) without having to install anything.

* [Hello World!](helloworld.html) - Everybody's favorite example
* [Navomatic](navomatic.html) - Automatic navigation using Borders and Links
* [GuestBook](guestbook.html) - A tiny blogger demonstrating ListViews and
  Forms
* [Using DropDownChoice](dropdownchoice.html) - A short example explaining the
  DropDownChoice component
* [Markup Inheritance](markupinheritance.html) - A short example explaining
  markup inheritance
* [Ajax Counter](ajaxcounter.html) - A short example explaining Wicket's Ajax
  features building a counter.
* [Using Fragments](usingfragments.html) - A short example explaining Wicket's
  fragments feature. Fragments are a type of inline panels.
