title: IDE Support for Wicket development
---

For all leading IDE's support is under development. Here's a list of efforts
for the major IDE's.

* Eclipse: [Wicket Bench](http://www.laughingpanda.org/mediawiki/index.php/Wicket_Bench), [Qwickie](http://code.google.com/p/qwickie)
* Netbeans: [NB Wicket Support](https://nbwicketsupport.dev.java.net/)
* IntelliJ IDEA: [Wicket Forge](http://wicketforge.googlecode.com/)

These projects are not maintained or supported by the core Wicket team, but
by their respective development teams.
