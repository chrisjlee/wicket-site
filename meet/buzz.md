title: Wicket Buzz

Wicket has appeared in the press in a variety of industry trade magazines,
including Network World, ComputerWorld, IT World and Information Week.
Presentations on Wicket have been delivered by Wicket team members at JavaOne
in San Francisco, Javapolis and TheServerSide Java Symposium in Europe. The
following are quotes from reviewers and users of Wicket:

> After working with JSF for almost a year, trying Wicket was like that
> movie scene where the clouds part and this big ray of light hits you
> in the face. I just had this feeling while JSF'ing that certain things
> were harder than they needed to be. Well, I was right, and the Wicket
> people figured it out.

> Wicket (currently undergoing incubation with Apache) is a good
> example of a web framework which throws caution to the wind, and has
> absolutely no XML needed. We here at Mystic have a lot of love for
> Wicket and are actively developing several projects with it currently.

> Writing a Wicket app is rather more like writing an event-based
> desktop application than a web application.

> "Wickedly Cool" - I actually managed to whip together a Wicket
> Application in a few days. It is entertaining to work with, adding
> shiny stuff is really easy while you can develop Java code and keep
> those last bits of hair you have saved for ripping out in a CSS
> nightmare that you hopefully after finding Wicket will not have to
> deal with.  So I'd go out on a limb and say that Wicket == Rogaine for
> developers.

> "So is Wicket the one true MVC framework that a lot of us have been

> "I think its an awesome way to deal with this whole web UI framework

> like the direction the framework is going... Wicket is clean, simple
> and elegant."

> The issue that impressed me in the Wicket model is that "Wicket does
> not mix markup with Java code and adds no special syntax to your
> markup files." You reference Wicket identities as HTML attributes
> and define component properties in Java, which allows designers and
> programmers to work independently (within the obvious constraint of
> having common goals). There is no need for special tools.
>
> From a Network World editorial entitled "Nothing Sticky about Wicket"

> In a recent blog post I asked for feedback on what Web frameworks
> folks are using. Well, I got quite a surprise: Wicket was the most
> often recommended framework in reader emails!

> From an About.com article entitled And the Winner is...Wicket

> "I have used Wicket since last Fall for personal projects. I have 3
> kids and a wife so my free-time is very limited. Given that, I had to
> be very picky about which framework I chose.  I've been very impressed
> with how little hassle it has been to start creating powerful,
> reusable components and pages with Wicket even under rather severe
> time constraints."

> "...after using web MVC frameworks for a couple of years, building
> ever more complex web applications, I moved to component based
> frameworks. Of these, I think Wicket is by far the best..."

> Comment on Manageability.org

> "... Talk about a mind blowing experience, it literally took me ten
> minutes to have a sample application up and running! The Wicket API is
> very Swing like, which was a welcome change for me, and allowed for a
> very familiar development experience. There is even an extension that
> allows for direct use of a Swing TreeModel. There are so many things
> that I like about this framework ..."
