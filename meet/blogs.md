Any (open source) project exists solely because a community wants to support
it. The Wicket community consists of the users and developers. There are many
who want to share their experiences with Wicket and do so on the mailing
lists , on several online media portals (for example The ServerSide and
JavaLobby ), and on their blogs.

Here is a list of regular Wicket bloggers, consisting of core contributers and enthusiastic users.
